# Timer A Blink

## Purpose
To blink multiple LEDs using on board timers.
## Theory
The timers were used to blink one LED on each board at 10Hz while the other LED blinked at 5Hz. The Timers created a more accurate way to blink the LED at exactly a certain clock cycle instead of waiting after a certain amount of clock cycles.
